# Deep Learning Experiments

A personal repository for learning and experimenting with deep learning concepts, frameworks, and techniques.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a hands-on workspace for:

- Exploring deep learning architectures and algorithms
- Implementing models from research papers
- Testing different frameworks and libraries
- Building practical projects and experiments

## Topics to Explore

- Neural Network Fundamentals
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers and Attention Mechanisms
- Generative Models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion)
- Reinforcement Learning
- Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning

## Notes

This is a learning repository - code may be experimental and not production-ready.
